# Enhanced Grammar Analysis Features

## Overview

The freestyle speech endpoint (`/freestyle-speech/analyze`) now includes comprehensive grammar analysis features similar to your existing grammar analysis route. This provides detailed IELTS-style assessment with differences tracking, lexical analysis, and model answers.

## New Response Structure

The `grammar` field in the `FreestyleSpeechResponse` now includes:
